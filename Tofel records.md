### Exercise 1-- TPO 20 Do things we know or try new things and take risks

 	Undoubtedly, all of us, are chasing success as successful people do ,who run after their higher dreams. The issue what makes success is old stuff. Only doing one thing or challenging themselves to new area? The answer is quite simple. A people staying around would never be successful enough. In my perspective, doing one thing well is the base of success, to get to the top, challenging self to new things or even taking risks is needed. 

​	Successful people would never be staying around. To dig, to excavate new possibility is their approach to success. For instance, Jobs went to some bottleneck in a period in his career, but his innovative talent and the curiosity to the new things rob him out of the mire in the life. He put up with a concept creatively, which was offering a platform for both hardware manufacturer and the app developers. Just one creative idea broke through the traditional notion in the electron industry, which was focusing on either hardware production or software exploitation. Jobs, whose concept saves and flourishes Apple made the risk to fortune.

​	Trying new things and taking risks always means one’s will to get in touch more and more things in the world. Only creativity and innovation could bring enormous improvement in one’s development. As for current college students, one of significant quality is to search the unknown. I used to be really unfamiliar with the use of computer. Instead of ==escaping away(逃避)== from the shortcoming, I take some related courses and practice hard on programming and basic use of lots of software. The process is really enjoyable with the satisfactory outcome.

​	However, trying new things never refers to randomly switching to different area. Actually, the ability and the determination to do one thing well and master it is the base of success. Doing one thing well needs concentration and persistence which help us get rid of the ==impetuous（浮躁）== atmosphere of the society. The innovation and creativity stem from what we learn and what we master. The reason we stress that challenge and attempt is to point out not to be confined by what we learn. ==The comfort zone could be a nice and safe port , but won’t be the mountain top.==

### Exercise 2-- TPO 20 Do things we know or try new things and take risks

The choice between the policies of "let it burn" or "suppress natural fire" for forest has become a issue for the society. From the professor's point of view, "let it burn" policy shouldn't be blamed since lots of criticism are lack of reason and foundation. On the contrast, the fire in the forest is a natural which could benefit the forest instead. 

Take the Yellow Stone fire in the 1980s as an example. 

First, although the fire caused temporary damage to trees and other plants, it also provided chances for small vegetation since there was less shade of large trees in the forest. In addition, some seeds of some plants, ==which could sustain high heat remained.==

First, although the fire caused temporary damage to trees and other plants like the reading describes, it also provided chances for some vegetation. For one thing, since there was less large trees in the forest, the small vegetation needed open air environment got chance to survive. In addition, some seeds of some plants, which could required high heat to germinate also took a place in the forest after the fire. 

Second, the reading passage tells that the fire caused damage to negative influence to animals. But, the park wildlife was even more thriving after the fire rather than suffering damage. On the one hand, some small animals,which was relatively rare in the forest got opportunity to propagate. On the other hand, the extension of small animals like rabbits offered enough food for the ==preyders(predators)==, so the food chain kept and even became more diverse and stronger.

Third, tourist wasn't influenced a lot. The different view of Yellow Stone Park also attracted some people, whose number dropped by only a low rate. Not long after the fire, tourists came back and the tourism became normal.

==Third, the reading claims that the fire reduce the value of the Yellow Stone as a tourism park. However, the fire of the level like 1988 is a coincidence since the combination of lack of rain and storm happens at a really low possibility. After the fire, tourists came back and the tourism became normal.==

### Exercise 3 -- TPO19 News Resources

With the sharp development of the computing ability of servers and basic improvement in the manufacture of  chips, we have stepped into an ==information age== in which the capacity to get accurate and deep information becomes extremely significant.  In this information age, journalism ==flourishes== as well with substantial companies and large amount of self media.  When it comes to information receivers, lots of people think obtaining  information from diverse news resources might work well. However, this is just the illusion which brings self-contradiction.

Firstly, extension of the news resources never means accuracy of news. One of the main cause is that there are massive comments from internet users and many self media workers. However, lots of them are not truly responsible for their speech. For instance, they may just focus only several key words to ==spread some extreme opinions== on the event to ==attract visitor volume and page view== which makes profits. However, if you don't pay enough attention to that, you might guess that is the truth. Days later, when official announcement comes out, you may find it is just a small case. This kind of media or comments exactly earn profits from consuming your emotion and so-called sense of justice and you would never be well-informed.

Secondly, it really takes time to integrate lots of news resources since busy is the normality of life. Only when we don't have important tasks or works can we spend several minutes to view some news to understand what is happening around us such as listening to specific news report radio while driving cars. If you need to get multiple channels of news, you have to organize the materials and analyze the relation between them which may be unfeasible.

From my point of view, picking 2 or 3 styles of authoritative media could be a reasonable method to get ourselves  well-informed, which won't consume too much time. When driving a car, we can just focus the CNN and NBC channel which is  subjective and real to a great extent. We could also watch some NBC discussion program while eating dinner. It doesn't take extra time to absorb those news. Then comparing some differences between 2 different reports might also contribute to the accuracy and depth of the obtained information . 

In conclusion, utilizing many news resources to become well-informed is not a wise choice in that the society is ==flooded with too many news media whose quality should be questioned==. Combining 2 or 3 authoritative news resources could make us relatively well-informed.

### Exercise4 -- TPO18 Friends or Teachers

Different kinds of people in this world has influenced or made some changes to our life. Parents instruct us some basic living skills, teachers teach us knowledge and inform us to be polite, friend ==accompany== us and support us. As for the argument teacher influences our life more than friends, I opposite with this statement. 

We can not deny that teachers shapes our knowledge system and also teach us some basic polite manners. However, their impact is mostly ==confined in== study. In most cases, they are not  familiar with one individual's life deeply. Therefore, the instructions about the area excluding study are sometimes not that useful although lots of them are definitely true. On the contrast, friends learn, play and live with us. They might ==have a stronger impact on== our habits and mindset in a more powerful way.

Firstly, our living habits are related to friends' behavior to a great extent. The atmosphere of the friend circle really shapes our life. For instance, in the college, one interesting phenomenon exists, which is that the behavior of the roomie are similar. You might see that either the whole dorm ==are indulged in== in playing games or the whole dorm go to the library to study. The attitudes of life depends on the people who lives  around you. The teacher might remind you to be positive and ==diligent==. But the surrounding friends' positive action is a more effective stimulus to us.

Secondly, friends provide emotional support for us. If we feel lost and sad, we always turn to our friends to talk about some pain to release our pressure. Even parent is not first choice , ==let alone(needless to say )==the teachers because. Since friends are often at the same age and at the same stage of life, we can share lots of topic they are from another generation. This kind of communication is the indispensable part in growth. In the most stressed time of the Chinese entrance test, I would spend some time after school to talk with my best friend . We inspire each other and move forward together. The motivation and encouragement from friends can not be replaced.  

Taking those reasons above into consideration, I tend to agree that friends influence our life more because they reshape our habits and attitudes towards life and provide support in our mentality.

## Exercise 5 -- TPO17 ad fake

With the flourishment of the information media and the diversity of mobile electronic products, the advertisements playing a more and more significant role in the market nowadays. The issue related to how to advertise, where and when to advertise has become a subject which enormous companies are paying attention to. However, from my personal perspective, most advertisement's description are relatively better than what they truly are, to stimulate the desire of the customers to buy the products.

Firstly, the appearance, the obvious part which customer would notice, is excessively beautified in the advertisement. Take the car ad as an example. When I saw a car ad in the TV, I was amazed at the oil paint which was brilliant and shining. In addition, the price was really reasonable. But, the last time my friend Nash and I came to a 4s car shop to purchase one, I got a glance at the particular car ==unconsciously==. It seemed really normal, and the oil paint was not that smoothing. Then I realized it was just the lighting technique in the ad that contribute to the car's fantastic outlook. The appearances in the ad are always cheating our eyes and influencing our judgement to a great extent, although there are always some remind statements.

Secondly, the function of the products are also exaggerated and some fundamental drawbacks are masked. There are so many cases that the olders would be induced to buy some expensive health care products because the function of those medicine or food are depicted like magic bullets. These kind of advertisements would ignore the necessary condition, and they just show the benefits, even masking some potential dangerous threat to health. There are a bunch of skills to make an advertisement's function seem greater such us hiring stars to make the ad TV program or interviewing some fake users. 

Taking those reasons above, the advertisement are truly often greater than the products. Although it isn't that fair to customers, it is the rule and the truth of the market. 

#### *Judgement

1. There is no denying that the advertisement provide useful information to guide our purchase
2. sparse no effort to demonstrate how wonderful there products are.

## Exercise 6 -- TPO16 

With the prosperity of diverse means of transportation, traveling has become a indispensable way for modern people to relax. We can enjoy brilliant scene and make some friends during the trip. In    addition, the forms of traveling are also different. From my perspective, joining a tour group with tour guide is an ideal way to enjoy the trip.

Firstly, the group guide will arrange for the tour schedule and handle the problem of transportation. Since we, tourists, are not familiar with the traffic condition of the viewing city or place, we often get into trouble with when to set off, how to select the route to avoid traffic jam. This really influences the experience of the trip. When there is a guide in the group who knows so well about the city, then he would make things easy for us. Also, we could list the places we want to visit, and then he could prepare a referred visiting order for us, whose orderliness will also contribute to our enjoyment.

Second, the guide could explain the history of the scenic spot which enrich our understanding of the culture behind the scenery. For instance, last time I went to Qing Shi Huang's Buried Sculpture Legion, the knowledgeable tour guide mentioned that we should not only see the superficial amazing appearance of the sculpture. He stressed that the ruins were indeed amazing work in the whole world which displayed exquisite design and grandeur, but behind those sculptures were the painful abusement of the slave who were downtrodden by those ruling class. I guess these kind of information and explanation could stimulate more thought about the tourism spot which is what I want.

Thirdly, there might be some like-minded people in the group and the group trip provides a nice chance to make some friends. When I came to Mountain Tai, I wanted to climb it the whole way. Then I met a nice person who also desired to do that. So we accompanied each other in the dangerous but meaningful way and took photos together. We finally became friends in the trip and share lots of topics in the trip.

Considering those reasons above, traveling in a group with a nice guide would attribute to happiness of the trip, and should be an perfect way of traveling.

### Exercise 7 -- TPO15 money management

The ability of independence is often stressed for cultivating children in the modern society. When it comes to the education of sense of responsibility for children, there are different opinions on it. Providing the chance for children to manage the money at a young age should be a reasonable and useful method.

Firstly, children could form the provident diet in the process of money management. Instead of asking parents for everything, the children are given a certain amount of money. So they need to use them in schedule. If they wants to buy some thing really expensive like some high-performance computers for programming, they need to save money for a period of time rather than getting it easily by begging parents. To get enough deposit, they can't waste money unconsciously and they would fineness a careful money plan. The diet of being frugal in the expenditure is significantly important for the future life.

Secondly, the money management could contribute to the study of new skills. My best friend Nash, who is interested in web design, learnt several software in the summer just to do an outsourcing program of a company to earn enough money to renew his Graphics Card. It seems no relation between money management and the study and lifestyle. However, without the notion of money management, children won't have that strong motivation.

Finally, good money management gives the children a sense of success. Every time they get something by saving the exploits or the earning the money , they would feel satisfactory and proud, which is an indispensable part in their growth. When they try to do some investment as adults in the future, the cautiousness and carefulness are "inherent", since they have formed a sense of responsibility for money management.

Take those reasons above, learning to manage the money at a young age is definitely a beneficial education method.
